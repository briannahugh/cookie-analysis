The initial data set consists of scraped data with 4 fields - url, title, ingredients, and directions.  
After the data is cleaned, for each ingredient the type, quantity, unit, and weight in grams is extracted.  
The baking temperature and oven time is extracted from the directions.  
This extracted data is then used to calculate the amount of protein (found in egg, and specific types of flour), fat (butter and oil), sucrose (sugar, honey, syrup), and water (found in many different ingredients) in each recipe, which are good predictors for crispiness, chewiness, spread, and texture (i.e. smooth versus crinkled).
